description: This striking story is dominated by the heroic John Scarborough, a wealthy
  squire who, with almost superhuman energy, contrives from his deathbed to defeat
  the hated law of entail. Seeking to bequeath his estate to the worthier of his two
  sons, in his pursuit of justice he subjects them to a testing examination, baffles
  the lawyers, and scandalizes society. The social world also comes under Trollope's
  ironic gaze. His searching treatment of the various codes governing courtship and
  marriage, money-lending, frustration of youth and the sadness of age.
